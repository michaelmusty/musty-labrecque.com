    <h3>Thanks!</h3>
    <p>
    We would like to take this opportunity to say
    thanks to all the people that have been
    there for us over the years.
    There are certainly many of you out
    there, and you know who you are!
    Without your love and support
    there is no way we would be where we are
    today.
    Thanks again for everything!
    We love you!
    </p>
    <h3>Registry?</h3>
    <p>
      There have been some inquiries about a registry.
      We do not have a wedding registry.
      We are more than happy just to see your smiling faces
      on September 22.
      Seriously.
      If you still want to get us something,
      a card, note, or your favorite recipe is more than enough.
      You could also make a donation to your favorite charity and let us
      know what it is!
      If you just like looking at registry stuff there are a few things
      left over from Nicole's bridal shower that you can find at
      <a href="https://www.target.com/gift-registry/giftgiver?registryId=9073c027124947ce9ebc5d39edd57189">tgt.gifts/mustylabrecque</a>
      .
    </p>
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>
      There have also been some inquiries about bringing children to our wedding.
      We did not include children in the head count,
      so we may not have room for a large number of children at the reception dinner
      (we will have a better idea about this after we have all the RSVPs on August 10th).
      If you want to bring children please indicate this on your RSVP
      or get in touch with us directly.
      We may have room for some children at dinner.
      In the case that there is not room for children at the dinner,
      you will need to arrange for a sitter during this time.
      This can be done directly through MML
      (see <a href="http://vermont-wedding.com/support/">http://vermont-wedding.com/support/</a>
      for more information about sitters).

      Sam Schiavone and Steve Lausier also provided some of the pictures here.
      Apparently only people with first names starting with "S" are allowed to
